# Open vs Whitelisted Jobs

By **Isaiah** & **basedgod**

## About
Jobs on FDG can be broadly placed into two categories: **Open** and **Whitelisted**. **Whitelisted** job employees can often have a significant impact on other players and therefore require a vetting process to prevent untrustworthy individuals from abusing their power. **Open** jobs are more accessible to newer players and often consist of easy tasks that provide small amounts of money.

## Whitelisted Jobs

Whitelisted jobs can primarily be categorised into two administrative areas, Department of Justice (DoJ)  and Department of Commerce (DoC) overseen by a Community Leader. These jobs often have a significant number of employees and extensive developmental support. There is also usually incentive to remain employed in a whitelisted job in order to advance through the organisation to achieve higher ranks!

A list of whitelisted jobs can be found below (This list is not exhaustive):

### DoJ Jobs
- San Andreas Police Force
- San Andreas Emergency Services
- San Andreas Ranger Service
- Judicial System - Lawyer/Paralegal

### DoC Jobs

- Car Dealerships (Premium Deluxe Motorsports, Valhalla)

Open jobs are fast and simple ways to make money. They also allow newer players to explore the server as they are sent around to complete a variety of tasks. These jobs are not administered by other players and do not require any application. They can be started at a variety of different locations and can be stopped at any time. 

A list of Non-whitelisted jobs can be found below (This list is not exhaustive):

- GO-Postal Delivery
- San Andreas Council Missions
- Diving
- Hunting/Fishing


## How to Apply for Whitelisted Jobs
Applying for jobs is easy and only takes a few minutes out of your day! Head to one of the five job centers located all over San Andreas.
