Forensics is a great way to close murder cases around Los Santos. A Forensics unit allows police officers from any department to investigate suspicious deaths and injuries by collecting many forms of physical evidence left at crime scenes. Activating forensics allows officers to determine many factors related to a crime such as bullet trajectory, bullet casings, blood samples and cross examine the physical evidence with our Criminal Database as well as murder weapons on scene.
