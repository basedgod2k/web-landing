# How to Clip FiveM

By **basedgod**


## About
When playing FDG, having clipping software is a necessity. For the sake of fair play, staff require footage from either party for reports to enforce the rules of the server as well as requesting compensation claims. The two most common clipping software used when playing FiveM are **Nvidia Shadowplay** & **Medal**.

If you have an Nvidia graphics card, you can easily set up instant replay within a matter of minutes. This is built into **Nvidia’s GeForce Experience** drivers. Shadowplay is a lot better for PC performance compared to Medal which is a lot more CPU intensive. Make sure you regularly update your graphics drivers. Watch our vdeo for an easy to follow tutorial on how to set up Shadowplay for FiveM. This covers how to turn on ingame overlay, instant replay and the configurations required to clip FiveM. 

Once you’ve got your footage, you can trim your clips easily using the Windows’ **Films & TV** application and upload it directly to either [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) or [Streamable](https://streamable.com).

Medal is an extremely convenient clipping software at the cost of some PC performance. Medal offers a built in video editor, easily accessible library and the ability to upload clips directly to medal.tv and link clips quickly.

- Clips can take up quite a lot of space. Making a habit of regularly trimming, uploading and deleting old clips can make it easily manageable.
- Some roleplay interactions can last a while, it is recommended to clip the last 5-10 minutes of gameplay. This is to ensure you don't miss out on any context of what you're trying to capture.
- Shadowplay doesn’t allow you to clip while watching streaming services such as **Netflix, Stan & Binge**. Keep that in mind if you are someone who likes to watch shows while gaming.
